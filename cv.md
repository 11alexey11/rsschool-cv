## *Summary*
I am advanced PC user. I am studying to be programmer and I was interested in web development. So I started learning on my own by looking at HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses. I made simple web applications.

My goal is to learn how to develop applications that have optimized algorithms and good design. I want to learn how to use vanilla JavaScript, but I am also ready to learn other technologies.

I am patient, diligent, always ready to discover something new. I am tactful and polite, I always find a common language with a person I don't know.
